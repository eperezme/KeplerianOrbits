## Structure

The main codebase is located in the `src/com/company` directory. The two main classes are:

- `Main.java`: This is the entry point of the application.
- `Orbit.java`: This class represents a Keplerian orbit. It includes properties such as eccentricity, semi-major axis, longitude of the ascending node, argument of periapsis, inclination, and period. It also includes methods for setting up the orbit and updating the period and mean angular motion.

## Building

To build the project, you will need a Java development environment. Open the project in your IDE and build it using the built-in tools.

## Running

To run the application, execute the `Main` class from your IDE.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss your ideas before making changes.
